Introduction
------------

Building a home lab and organizing your network diagrams, installation and configuration notes, and other important information can be a challenging task. With notes scattered across various platforms, it's important to find a solution that centralizes your notes and makes them easily accessible. In this blog, we will introduce you to a static site generator that can help you create a good-looking, easy-to-maintain, and blazing fast website to host all your notes. Whether you want to host it in your home lab or in the cloud, this solution has got you covered.

Introducing Jekyll - An Open Source Site Generator
--------------------------------------------------

Jekyll is an open source site generator created by GitHub. It allows you to generate various types of websites, including blogs, marketing pages, photo galleries, and even documentation sites. In this blog, we will focus on using Jekyll to create a documentation site for your home lab. The best part is that Jekyll is a static site generator, which means it doesn't require databases, comments, or updates. It generates static HTML pages that can be served very fast, making it an ideal solution for hosting your notes.

Setting Up Your Documentation Site
----------------------------------

To start building your documentation site, you will need to set up a new Git repository. You can use GitHub Pages to host your website for free, or you can choose to host it on your own server in your home lab. If you decide to use GitHub Pages, you can follow these steps:

1.  Create a new Git repository on GitHub.
2.  Apply a theme that matches the one you want for your documentation site.
3.  Customize the site to fit your needs.
4.  Create your first post and preview the changes in real-time.
5.  Deploy your site to GitHub Pages using the built-in deployment feature.

If you prefer to host your site in your own environment, you can simply clone the repository to your local machine and customize it accordingly. You can use a web server like Nginx or Apache to serve your static HTML pages.

Customizing Your Documentation Site
-----------------------------------

Once you have set up your documentation site, you can start customizing it to make it your own. The configuration settings for your site can be found in the config.yml file. Here, you can set the base URL, language, time zone, site title, description, and other global settings. You can also customize the theme mode to light or dark, set your social media handles, and enable commenting if you want to encourage engagement on your site.

In addition to the global settings, you can also customize individual pages and posts. You can create posts in Markdown syntax, which allows you to easily format your content and add code blocks, images, and other elements. Markdown is a simple and widely-used syntax that is easy to learn and use.

Hosting Your Documentation Site
-------------------------------

After customizing your documentation site, you can choose how to host it. If you decide to use GitHub Pages, you simply need to push your changes to your Git repository, and GitHub will automatically build and deploy your site. You can access your site using the URL provided by GitHub.

If you prefer to host your site on your own server, you can generate the static HTML pages using the Jekyll command line tool. Once you have the HTML files, you can copy them to your web server and configure it to serve them as the default pages. This gives you full control over your hosting environment and allows you to keep your site private if desired.

Conclusion
----------

Centralizing your notes and creating a web-based documentation site for your home lab doesn't have to be complicated or time-consuming. With a static site generator like Jekyll, you can quickly and easily create a good-looking, easy-to-maintain, and blazing fast site that meets all your requirements. Whether you choose to host it on GitHub Pages or in your own environment, the choice is yours. So why wait? Start organizing your notes and building your documentation site today!
